======================

Code for project submitted to JASA by Helen M. Jackson and Brian C. J. Moore
Requires Java 6


Java code with modules in c and fortran
Runs as-is in Eclipse, taking parameters via standard input (Run --> Run configurations --> Arguments)

Passed in are the following (ordered list):
isSharp	: Boolean : filters as specified by Glasberg and Moore (false), or twice as sharp (true)
internal noise : float : value of sigma
nTrials : int : number of trials to run
f0 : double : fundamental frequency
freqLowest : int : frequency of lowest component in flat part of bandpass filter
nComps : int : number of components in flat part of bandpass filter
shift : double : frequency shift in Hz
ampPert : double : parameter P -- limits of random amplitude perturbation
level : double : overall level of complex tone in dB SPL
TENlevel : double : level of threshold-equalising noise (TEN)

Some of the values passed in are fixed and do not need to cbe changed:
first trial number : 1
client : "hmw"
signal dur : 0.2 seconds
inter-stimulus interval : 0.3 seconds
ear : "left"
phase : "r" -- if you would like to have signals generated by the model in cosine phase, change this value in TFS1_class.java (first global variable)

To estimate a psychometric function for a set of parameters, vary the value of shift for a set of runs, with a maximum of 0.5F0. A threshold corresponding to 70.7% correct can then be estimated using probit analysis (not included in this model).

Definitions:
"trial": one set of tones generated, one response collected e.g. "correct"
"run": set of trials with responses collected and summed
"data point": result of a "run" e.g. "1501 correct out of 2000"
