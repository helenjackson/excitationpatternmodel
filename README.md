======================

Code for project submitted to JASA by Helen M. Jackson and Brian C. J. Moore<br>
Requires Java 6<br>

Java code with modules in c and fortran<br>
Runs as-is in Eclipse, taking parameters via standard input (Run --> Run configurations --> Arguments)<br>

Passed in are the following (ordered list):<br>
isSharp	: Boolean : filters as specified by Glasberg and Moore (false), or twice as sharp (true)<br>
internal noise : float : value of sigma<br>
nTrials : int : number of trials to run<br>
f0 : double : fundamental frequency<br>
freqLowest : int : frequency of lowest component in flat part of bandpass filter<br>
nComps : int : number of components in flat part of bandpass filter<br>
shift : double : frequency shift in Hz<br>
ampPert : double : parameter P -- limits of random amplitude perturbation<br>
level : double : overall level of complex tone in dB SPL<br>
TENlevel : double : level of threshold-equalising noise (TEN)<br>

Some of the values passed in are fixed and do not need to cbe changed:<br>
first trial number : 1<br>
client : "hmw"<br>
signal dur : 0.2 seconds<br>
inter-stimulus interval : 0.3 seconds<br>
ear : "left"<br>
phase : "r" -- if you would like to have signals generated by the model in cosine phase, change this value in TFS1_class.java (first global variable)<br>

To estimate a psychometric function for a set of parameters, vary the value of shift for a set of runs, with a maximum of 0.5F0. A threshold corresponding to 70.7% correct can then be estimated using probit analysis (not included in this model).<br>

Definitions:<br>
"trial": one set of tones generated, one response collected e.g. "correct"<br>
"run": set of trials with responses collected and summed<br>
"data point": result of a "run" e.g. "1501 correct out of 2000"<br>
